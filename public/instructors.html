<div class="grid_12" id="dawn">
 <img class="thumbnail" src="images/instructors/Dawn1.jpg" /><h4>Dawn Mazzeo, Director</h4>
 	BA Sarah Lawrence College<br>
    Certifications: Peak Pilates - Mad Dogg Athletics, Piloxing, Barre
    <p>Dawn is trained in classical ballet and modern dance. She earned a BA from Sarah Lawrence College where she studied dance and anatomy. Upon graduation, Dawn danced at the Merce Cunningham Studio in Manhattan.  Pilates was an integral part of her dance training as it appealed to her fascination with the mind/body connection.  Dawn teaches ballet to young dancers and recently completed a 40 hours Peak Pilates classical mat certification.</p>  
<p>Her love of physical fitness extends to spin, barre and Piloxing (which fuses Pilates, boxing and ballet). Dawn has been dancing for 41 years (she got her first tutu at age three) and has never stopped. One of the joys in her life is sharing her love of dance and knowledge of how one can become fit and healthy through the proper use of their body and breath.</p>
<p>Dawn is very excited to become the new fitness Director of Kickfit (formerly known as Kick Fitness) as Kick was her first fitness home when she first came to Rumson 14 years ago. <br><br>

 <img class="thumbnail" src="images/instructors/Donna.jpg" /><h4>Donna Winchell</h4>
 B.S. Community Health Education<br>
University of North Carolina at Greensboro<br>
23 years of experience in fitness industry<br>
Certifications: ACE Group Exercise, ACE Personal Trainer, American Red Cross CPR/AED, Gravity, Spin - Mad Dogg Athletics, TRX
<p>My youngest child was two (now he's 26!), and I decided to take my first fitness class ever to get back into shape. I loved it so much that six weeks later I was in training to become an instructor; it was as though life brought me to this point and launched me! I was a cheerleader in high school, I went to college and studied health education, and I was a La Leche League leader for ten years. After a few group exercises classes, I thought, "This is something that will draw on my training and strengths and I will be good at it."</p>
<p>All these years later I am still a fitness instructor because I remain committed to helping women become strong and fit. My goal is to motivate women to work hard and enjoy the camaraderie that exists when friends play together.<br>
